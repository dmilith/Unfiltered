* The `server` field in prior version of `unfiltered.jetty.Server`
  (the wrapper's reference to the Jetty server object) is now
  `underlying`
* The `destroy` method of the underlying Jetty server is now promoted
  to the wrapper interface, and it is called automatcally from the
  `run` method. Destroying completed server instances frees PermGen
  space for long-running JVM sessions, such as those provided by
  interactive build and test tools.
