Request Chaining Refactor
-------------------------

In prior versions of Unfiltered, extractors generally passed their
source object into the extracted tuple, to support chaining by nesting
extractors. This provided the needed flexibility, but it littered
client code with `_`'s for unneeded request and map references. (Also,
it's rather un-fun to maintain in every extractor in the library.)

It was pointed out to us that Scala's pattern matching can be extended
to support this need with as a general operation.

    object & { def unapply[A](a: A) = Some(a, a) }

With this in scope, we can do:

    case GET(Path("/secret") & BasicAuth(name, pass)) =>

Because (if you're curious) that evaluates as:

    case GET(&(Path("/secret"), BasicAuth(name, pass))) =>

Refactoring client code from 0.2.x extractors is a bit painful, but
the improved readability should be worth it.

OAuth Module
------------

Support for the official [OAuth](http://oauth.net/) final [1.0](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849) provider specification.

An example [client](https://github.com/softprops/unfiltered-oauth-client.g8/#readme)
and [server](https://github.com/softprops/unfiltered-oauth-server.g8/#readme) have been provided as [g8](https://github.com/n8han/giter8/#readme) templates. Otherwise please see the OAuth module's [readme](https://github.com/n8han/Unfiltered/tree/master/oauth/#readme)
